# RNN
Stock Price Prediction
 
The branch of Deep Learning which facilitates this is Recurrent Neural Networks. Classic RNNs have short memory, and were neither popular nor powerful for this exact reason. But a recent major improvement in Recurrent Neural Networks gave rise to the popularity of LSTMs (Long Short Term Memory RNNs) which has completely changed the playing field.  

Implementation (RNN)this ultra-powerful model, and i took the challenge to use it to predict the real Google stock price. A similar challenge has already been faced by researchers at Stanford University and my aim is to do at least as good as them.
